# Monkeys Don't Like Green Bananas

The monkeys are tired of finding bananas, taking a closer look, and realizing that they're green, as they only like yellow bananas. So, they've decided to elminate the green bananas.
Using the yellow banana and your trusty mouse pointer, you can launch the monkey into the green bananas to destroy them. Good luck!

Warning: this game really isn't that fun. Like at all. I would only recommend using it as an example for Phaser CE that was built using the MDN Web Docs breakout game tutorial.
This repo is really for me to just learn how to use Git and GitHub. It's only public because I wanted it to be(for some reason).
