# Monkeys Don't Like Green Bananas

The monkeys are tired of finding bananas, taking a closer look, and realizing that they're green, as they only like yellow bananas. So, they've decided to elminate the green bananas.
Using the yellow banana and your trusty mouse pointer, you can launch the monkey into the green bananas to destroy them. Good luck!

Warning: this game really isn't that fun. Like at all. I would only recommend using it as an example for Phaser CE that was built using the MDN Web Docs breakout game tutorial.
This repo is really for me to just learn how to use Git and GitHub. It's only public because I wanted it to be(for some reason).

How to play(if you really want to):

1. Download the latest release.
2. Open VS Code(if you don't have it, go to code.visualstudio.com to get it).
3. Download the Live Server extension for VS Code(if you don't already have it).
4. Open the folder from step 1 in Visual Studio Code.
5. Open index.html, and click the Go Live button in the bottom-right corner.
6. The game should open in your favorite browser. Enjoy!
